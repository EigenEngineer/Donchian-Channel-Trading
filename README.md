"# Donchian-Channel-Trading" 

Introduction

The Donchian channel is a simple trend following technique for financial trading.  The channel is defined by the max and min prices the financial product traded at for the specified days in the past, e.g. 50 days.  The basic intuition is to trade on the side of the breakouts of the window as the move signifies a potential trend about to occur or already underway.  

A naive Dochian channel's implementation, i.e. commmitting all capital in position when breakout is identified, tends to lead to large volatilities in the portfolio.
